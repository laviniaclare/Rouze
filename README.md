#What is it?

Have you ever been on a bus and missed your stop because you fell asleep, were too drunk, or simply couldn't see the street signs?  This app is for you.  Rouze allows users to select the location of the stop they wish to get off at, then when the user gets within a few block of their stop Rouze will allert them with sound.  Rouze will continue to allert at regular intervals until the user cancels the alarm.

This is a work in progress, but will be deployed when it is completed.
